# VR Canvas Panel Project

## Phase 1: Basic WebXR Setup with Canvas Panel [LOCKED]
> ⚠️ Phase 1 is now locked and version controlled. No further changes will be made to Phase 1 code as we move forward with Phase 2.

### Features Implemented
- Three.js WebXR environment setup
- 320x180 canvas panel positioned in front of the user
- VR controller support with raycasting
- Meta Quest Emulator compatibility
- Raycasting activation only after entering VR mode

### Technical Details
- Canvas panel dimensions: 320x180 pixels (scaled to 3.2x1.8 meters in VR)
- Panel position: (0, 1.6, -2) - eye level, 2 meters in front
- Raycasting visualization with controller lines
- Event handling for controller interactions

### How to Run
1. Start a local server (using one of these commands):
   ```bash
   npx live-server --port=8080
   # or
   npx http-server
   ```
2. Open http://localhost:8080 in a WebXR-compatible browser
3. Click "Enter VR" to start the VR experience
4. Use Meta Quest Emulator controllers to interact with the canvas

### Project Structure
- `index.html` - Main HTML file with Three.js imports
- `main.js` - Core application logic and WebXR setup

### Initial Prompt
```
Create a three js file with Webxr feature. The scene should have a 320x180 canvas panel infront of me. 
I will use the scene for VR purpose. I already have the Meta Emulator plugin installed to test it in VR. 
I will use ray casting from the Emulator's controller to interact with the canvas. 
Only activate the raycasting after user clicks 'Enter VR'
```

**Version Control Note:**
- Phase 1 is git-tagged and locked for reference
- All future development will be part of Phase 2 and beyond
- Phase 1 commit hash: [910ea6f]

## Phase 2: Controller Visualization and Interaction Enhancement

### Features Implemented
- Added visible cubes to controllers for better spatial awareness
- Created modular architecture with separate components
- Enhanced controller ray visualization
- Added interactive feedback for left controller trigger
- Implemented proper object-oriented structure

### Technical Details
- Controller cubes: 8cm x 8cm x 8cm green cubes
- Ray visualization: 
  - Default: white, 2px width
  - Left controller trigger pressed: red, 5px width
- Modular structure:
  - `modules/ControllerCubes.js`: Handles controller cube visualization
  - `modules/ControllerRays.js`: Manages ray visualization and interaction

### Project Structure Updates
- `modules/`
  - `ControllerCubes.js` - Controller cube management
  - `ControllerRays.js` - Ray visualization and interaction
- `main.js` - Updated with modular integration
